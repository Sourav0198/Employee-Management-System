# poc-employee-mgmt-java

I have created a project on Employee Management System. Using spring boot and MySQL database. I have created multiple entities with multiple attributes and established different mappings for the same. I also validate the data for each entity and created separate custom DTOs for requests as well as responses. I have taken care of all the exception using global exception handler. JWT authentication has been implemented to restrict the API access based on the roles like User, Admin and HR.
